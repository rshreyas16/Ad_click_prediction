# Ad_click_prediction

## project Objective
In this project, we are going to work on an advertising dataset, indicating whether or not a particular internet user has clicked on an Advertisement.
The Goal of the project is to predict if a particular user is likely to click on particular ad or not based on the features. 

The EDA has been performed for this project and applied  many supervised ML models for this case study. All the models performed almost well.

## Conclusion
Comparing all the above implementation models, we conclude that Naive Bayes Algorithm gives us the maximum accuracy for determining the click probability. We believe in future there will be fewer ads, but they will be more relevant.
